# Interesting projects of mine
Interesting mini-projects that i developed in my free time. This repository contains the following:

## Genetic_algorithm_two_body_V1.0
1. A Genetic algorithm based algorithm, that was used to find an optimal solution for a model of
  a two body problem. The two body problem was used to simulate a rocket flying to the moon from Earth.

## Drone_orientation_module
2. An aplication that performed data analysis gathered in real time from an arduino with an accelerometer. The aplication had
  a simple GUI made in python that represented gathered data; a calibration module and a calculation module. The python backend was implemented
  using two threads, one that supported the GUI, and one that calculated roll, pitch and yaw of the arduino and some I/O opperations.

## ML_practice
3. Some Machine learning practice. And a stacked gradient boosed random tree model that was developed to classify different types
   of soil, given geological data underneath NIS oil rigs.
   
## Double_pendulum
4. A visualization and a simulation of a double pendulum.

## RoboControl
5. An unfinished python module for hand detection and teleoperation of a robot.
